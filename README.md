# python-DSA-practice
This repository contains my **Python programs** for learning and practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
Each program focuses on one concept with simple explanations and clean code.  
## Topics Covered  
-  Arrays  
-  Strings  
-  Searching  
-  Sorting  
-  Stacks  
-  Queues  
-  Basic Problems (Prime, Factorial, Reverse String, etc.)  

##  Example Programs  

### 1. Prime Number Checker  
     File: prime.py  

# Description  
This program checks whether a given number is a **prime number** or not.  

# How It Works  
1. The user enters a number.  
2. If it’s greater than 1, the program checks divisibility from 2 to num-1 
3. If divisible by any number → Not Prime  
4. Otherwise → Prime   

# Example Output  
Enter a number: 7
7 is a prime number




### 2.Factorial of a Number  
 File:factorial.py  

# Description  
This program finds the **factorial** of a number using both **loop** and **recursion** methods.  

# How It Works  
1. User inputs a number.  
2. The loop multiplies all numbers from 1 to n.  
3. Alternatively, recursion calls the same function until n = 1.  

# Example Output  
Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is 120




### 3. Reverse a String  
 File:reverse string.py  

# Description  
This program reverses a given string **without using built-in functions**.  

# How It Works  
1. Takes input string from the user.  
2. Loops through each character and adds it to the front of a new string.  
3. Displays the reversed result.  

# Example Output 
Enter a string: hello
Reversed string: olleh
